# dashboard-streamlit

## This repo aims to:
- Create a basic streamlit dashboard using [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset/code)


2. Create a basic streamlit dashboard with data that you have access to (e.g., de-identified data from a group project, or data that you find interesting that is publicly available). The data that you select should have at least one (if not more) of the following fields to be able to complete Step 3 of this assignment:
Date/time stamp 
Categorical data
Continuous data 
OPTIONAL: position/locational data 
The dashboard code and data being used should be included within the github repo 

3. The dashboard should include the following components based on the streamlit documentation (https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference) of what is available: 
a header 
some text 
a code-block 
2 dataframes
at least 2 charts (e.g., line, area, bar, scatter plot) 


4. Please deploy the streamlit application to AZURE
take screen shots of the deployed app with your IP (OR you can deploy it to your new domain name if you want to....)
